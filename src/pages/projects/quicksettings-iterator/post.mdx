import {FlexContainer, HalfWidth, ThirdWidth, TwoThirdsWidth, TwentyPercentWidth, CustomWidth } from '../../../components/post'

#### Motivation
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
        Generative art sketches are often created with code that draws according to input parameters, where changing these parameters can change the output image.
    </ThirdWidth>
    <HalfWidth>
        Example sketch with one variable changed 4 times.
    </HalfWidth>

    <ThirdWidth>
        To add a simple UI to adjust parameters, I use [quicksettings](https://github.com/bit101/quicksettings) by bit101.
        However, this requires manual work to see all the possibilities.
        ** What if there were an automatic way to visualize the entirety of a sketchâ€™s parameter space? **

#### Initial Approach
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
        I thought it would be interesting to try animating the change in parameters over time.

        To do this, I created my own fork of the quicksettings repo, and implement a simple function to increase each parameter by one each time step.
