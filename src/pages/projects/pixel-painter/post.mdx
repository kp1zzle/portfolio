short_description: "An integrated online platform to create pixel art."
long_description: "Pixel Painter is both an experimental art creation tool and a series of animated pixel artworks. A kernel fixed at the center of the screen paints on a blank canvas while the canvas moves beneath it. This platform leverages a GLSL shader, so that each frame is defined in terms of the previous frame and a series of boolean inputs."

import {FlexContainer, HalfWidth, ThirdWidth, TwoThirdsWidth, TwentyPercentWidth, CustomWidth, Caption, } from '../../../components/post'

#### Motivation
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
       Imagine a pen held in a fixed position with a paper moved under it. The pen can be raised and lowered independently of paper movement. This simple idea was the basis for this digital exploration.
