short_description: "An integrated online platform to create pixel art."
long_description: "Pixel Painter is both an experimental art creation tool and a series of animated pixel artworks. A kernel fixed at the center of the screen paints on a blank canvas while the canvas moves beneath it. This platform leverages a GLSL shader, so that each frame is defined in terms of the previous frame and a series of boolean inputs."

#### Motivation
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
       Imagine a pen held in a fixed position with a paper moved under it. The pen can be raised and lowered independently of paper movement. This simple idea was the basis for this digital exploration.

    </ThirdWidth>
</FlexContainer>

#### Initial Approach
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
        I set out to build a system where each subsequent frame is calculated based on the previous frame. Instead of
        defining all the geometry in the work at once, we only need to define the change: whether the image is moved up,
        down, left, or right. This can be passed into the shader as boolean inputs, so that we can determine a pixel's
        value for the frame by looking at the pixels around it. For example, if up is true, then the value for pixel x,y
        in the current frame would be the value for pixel x,y-1 in the previous frame.

#### Additional Features
##### Kernels
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
       Kernel color and design can be changed.
    </ThirdWidth>
    <ThirdWidth>
        <CustomWidth width={"83%"}>
            `video: ./color.mp4`
        </CustomWidth>
        <FlexContainer>
            <CustomWidth width={"30%"}>
                ![square](./square.png )
                <Caption>Square</Caption>
            </CustomWidth>
            <CustomWidth width={"30%"}>
                ![dots](./dots.png )
                <Caption>Dots</Caption>
            </CustomWidth>
            <CustomWidth width={"30%"}>
                ![triangle](./triangle.png )
                <Caption>Triangle</Caption>
            </CustomWidth>
        </FlexContainer>
    </ThirdWidth>
</FlexContainer>

##### Speed
<TwoThirdsWidth>
    Movement speed can be changed by changing how many pixels we move each frame.
</TwoThirdsWidth>
<TwoThirdsWidth>
    <FlexContainer>
        <CustomWidth width={"30%"}>
            `video: ./speed-1.mp4`
            <Caption>1px/frame</Caption>
        </CustomWidth>
        <CustomWidth width={"30%"}>
            `video: ./speed-5-trimmed.mp4`
            <Caption>5px/frame</Caption>
        </CustomWidth>
        <CustomWidth width={"30%"}>
            `video: ./speed-10-trimmed.mp4`
            <Caption>10px/frame</Caption>
        </CustomWidth>
    </FlexContainer>
</TwoThirdsWidth>
##### Pen up/down
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
        The pen can be raised and lowered so that we can navigate the canvas without drawing on it.
    </ThirdWidth>
    <CustomWidth width={"25%"}>
        `video: ./pentoggle.mp4`
    </CustomWidth>
</FlexContainer>
##### Color Inversion
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
        All colors on the canvas can be inverted while leaving the kernel unchanged.
    </ThirdWidth>
    <CustomWidth width={"25%"}>
        `video: ./invert.mp4`
    </CustomWidth>
</FlexContainer>

#### Manual Mode
<FlexContainer>
    <HalfWidth>
        For initial experimentation, I wired up each fo the features to keys on the keyboard to create a manual mode for artwork creation.

        The experience of creating an artwork in manual mode is across between playing an instrument and playing a video game.
        A combination a timing, dexterity, and technical mastery is necessary to execute an exciting artwork.

            <CustomWidth width={"65%"}>
                `video: ./manual_artwork_min.mp4`
            </CustomWidth>
        </FlexContainer>
    </HalfWidth>
    <CustomWidth width={"27%"}>
        `video: ./manual.mp4`
    </CustomWidth>
</FlexContainer>

#### Pixel Painter Command Language (PPCL)


<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
        In PPCL, one line defines one frame of the animation.

    </ThirdWidth>
</FlexContainer>

    **Commands:**
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td>`up`</td>
        <td>Move the kernel up one pixel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`down`</td>
        <td>Move the kernel down one pixel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`left`</td>
        <td>Move the kernel left one pixel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`right`</td>
        <td>Move the kernel right one pixel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`kernelSize=10`</td>
        <td> Sets the side length of the kernel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`kernelMode=solid` </td>
        <td>Sets the kernel mode.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`kernelParam=2` </td>
        <td>Sets the optional param for the kernel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`kernelColor=0,0,0`</td>
        <td> Sets the rgb values for the kernel color.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`invert`</td>
        <td> Inverts all colors in the image.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`togglePen`</td>
        <td> Toggles the kernel writing on the canvas.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`penUp`</td>
        <td> Sets the pen to not write on the canvas.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`penDown`</td>
        <td> Sets the pen to write on the canvas.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    **Control Structures:**

    Only two simple control structures exist in PPCL: line repetition and block repetition.

    Prepend a command line with an integer N to repeat that command end times: `5 up` 5 frames of up animation.

    Wrap a block in parens prepended with an integer N to repeat the block N times. Note that the parens MUST have their own lines.
    ```
    3 (
    up
    down
    left
    )
    invert
    ```

</HalfWidth>

Note that multiple directional commands can be combined in the same command line (for diagonal motion).

I also created a javascript interface to initialize Pixel Painter with pre-defined PPCL commands and manual mode disabled.

I also implemented a mechanism to record commands in manual mode and export the PPCL. In this way, manual mode can be used as a testing/experimentation ground to generate PPCL for use in future artworks.

#### Infinite Artworks
When Pixel Painter finishes executing a PPCL script, it restarts execution from the beginning of the script without clearing the canvas.
As a result, we can use PPCL to create infinite artworks, so long as the PPCL script leaaves the kernel in a different position than it started.

#### Using Javascript to Generate PPCL
This can be used with tools like fxhash or more complex logic to infinite sequences with patterns that are generated parametrically.
