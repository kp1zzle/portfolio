short_description: "An integrated online platform to create pixel art."
long_description: "Pixel Painter is both an experimental art creation tool and a series of animated pixel artworks. A kernel fixed at the center of the screen paints on a blank canvas while the canvas moves beneath it. This platform leverages a GLSL shader, so that each frame is defined in terms of the previous frame and a series of boolean inputs."

import {FlexContainer, HalfWidth, ThirdWidth, TwoThirdsWidth, TwentyPercentWidth, CustomWidth, Caption, } from '../../../components/post'

#### Motivation
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
       Imagine a pen held in a fixed position with a paper moved under it. The pen can be raised and lowered independently of paper movement. This simple idea was the basis for this digital exploration.

    <ThirdWidth>
        `video: ./inspo.mp4`
    </ThirdWidth>
</FlexContainer>

#### Initial Approach
<FlexContainer>
    <ThirdWidth>
        I set out to build a system where each subsequent frame is calculated based on the previous frame. Instead of
        defining all the geometry in the work at once, we only need to define the change: whether the image is moved up,
        down, left, or right. This can be passed into the shader as boolean inputs, so that we can determine a pixel's
        value for the frame by looking at the pixels around it. For example, if up is true, then the value for pixel x,y
        in the current frame would be the value for pixel x,y-1 in the previous frame.
